so okay let me tell you whats my idea, users will log in (so we need users accounts makes sense) and then they will have in main page, a sections that they can work with (enable disable favourite, ext) in these sections i am for now thinking, Food (like add each meal of the day for tracking), then suplements (most likely a check boxes if they took em that day) and their lifts (that would be considered from calendar how they set it up, they will have calendar and set their split) in each day they will see the workouts to do, they can add how much they lifted and if they completed it, also they can add if they did something outside their regular split so if they normaly for example dont have deadlifts in their day, and they did them, they can add that, that they did that that day. all of that data needs to be stored.
